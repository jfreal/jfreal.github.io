                <p>
                    Worked with a client to streamline a manual and paper intensive process into a digital one. The business uses this software on a daily basis to help manage a large quantity of incoming orders and customer support issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although simple conceptually the system relies on a 3rd party SQL Server database backend which wasn't built with extensibility in mind. Working through the challenges with the client we built a system which runs alongside the existing database and integrates
                    without being obtrusive or posing any risks to the integrity of 3rd party data.

                    guitarcenter.com is a 10 year old project and underneath the covers was a wide mixture of different ASP.NET methodologies and techniques used over the years.

                        As a small business owner with limited technical knowledge finding a software developer who can understand your business needs and turn them into usable functioning software is very difficult. John has done an extraordinary job of sitting down with me,
                        analyzing my problems, and using outside the box thinking to come up with creative solutions to solve my problems. I have lots of ideas but I don’t have lots of time, working with John has enabled me to write a brief description
                        of what I want and then he spends the time to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it. Many other developers stray down the wrong path and waste your money because they don’t fully understand your needs.

                        If John is not 100% sure of the direction he is headed he will setup a meeting to discuss and gain full clarity before proceeding forward. The main application that John has created for my business has completely streamlined my operation. I couldn't imagine
                        not having it at this point. It has been a pleasure working with John and I look forward to working with him for years to come.

                    <p>As a colleague of John at the UConn Health Center I can honestly say he is one of the brightest programmers I have ever had the pleasure to work with. His abilities in the .Net world, and in all other aspects of programing, is remarkable.
                        I would proudly recommend John for any endeavor he wished to embark upon.

                        John and I were co-workers at PageFad. John was hired as a Junior Level Developer but quickly proved himself to be more knowledgeable than that. He was well versed in C#, ASP.NET, CSS, JavaScript and Ajax. Now, although he was hired to do mostly Web Development
                        his skills also shined in SQL Server 2005. He worked well in both Database administration and design.

                        I would have to say his knowledge of Web Development is his greatest attribute. However, that is not to take away from the fact that he is very easy to work with. I would definitely work with him again if had the chance.
