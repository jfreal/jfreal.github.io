                <p>I love being innovative, but favor building on foundations of rock solid and proven solutions.

                                At a lot of companies, to much of the software process is counting closed tickets or

                    <p>
                        As a small business owner with limited technical knowledge finding a software developer who
                        can
                        understand your business needs and turn them into usable functioning software is very
                        difficult. John has done an <strong>extraordinary job of sitting down with me,
                            analyzing my problems, and using outside the box thinking to come up with creative
                            solutions to
                            solve my problems</strong>. I have lots of ideas but I don‚Äôt have lots of time, working
                        with John
                        has
                        enabled me to write a brief description
                        of what I want and then he spends the time to figure out what the problem is and how to
                        solve
                        it. Many other developers stray down the wrong path and waste your money because they don‚Äôt
                        fully understand your needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If John is not 100% sure of the direction he is headed he will setup a meeting to discuss
                        and
                        gain full clarity before proceeding forward. The main application that John has created for
                        my
                        business has completely streamlined my operation. I couldn't imagine
                        not having it at this point. It has been a pleasure working with John and I look forward to
                        working with him for years to come.

                <p>
                    When I transitioned to C# Full-Stack development from Web Design and PHP, my first contract was
                    developing
                    an e-commerce application from scratch that helped a small retail outlet <strong>10x their
                        sales</strong> in a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides working for other people I've had some small scale business success with:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developing a prototype lead scraping software and selling the source code to a buyer.</li>
                    <li>Starting my own SaaS company and doing from prototype to reoccurring revenue.</li>
                    <li>Buying a event calendar PHP script business, redesigning the marketing page, and selling the
                        product .</li>
                    <li>Creating an affiliate website and earning commissions off sales.</li>

                </ul>

                    I've worked with John on a number of complex web dev projects over the last few years. John is a pro
                    and <strong>someone I can count on</strong>, whether it is to advise on best approach, or dive deep
                    to resolve some
                    obscure bug. John can jump in and ramp up quickly, which is critical in the work that we do. He is
                    an <strong>excellent communicator</strong> and has always made himself accessible to us regardless
                    of geographic
                    location.

                    <p>Sometime you come across an individual who really makes you question your own
                        abilities. John is such a person. He produces <strong>excellent quality code</strong> using
                        the
                        right technology and truly understands the depths of the
                        technology that he is utilizing. He's up to date on the latest ideas and trends and yet
                        <strong>implements
                            them wisely</strong> and not because it's the latest trend. I look forward to working
                        with
                        him again in the future.</p>

                        I have known John Farrell professionally for a number of years and have placed him at
                        multiple
                        clients in the greater Hartford area as a .NET Developer. He is a talented IT professional
                        who
                        <strong>consistently receives positive feedback</strong> on his work and has been
                        <strong>requested to return to client sites</strong> as additional needs arise.

                        John‚Äôs skill set is in high demand at the moment and his <strong>easygoing and engaging
                            personality</strong>

                        As a small business owner with limited technical knowledge finding a software developer who
                        can
                        understand your business needs and turn them into usable functioning software is very
                        difficult. John has done an <strong>extraordinary job of sitting down with me,
                            analyzing my problems, and using outside the box thinking to come up with creative
                            solutions to
                            solve my problems</strong>. I have lots of ideas but I don‚Äôt have lots of time, working
                        with John
                        has
                        enabled me to write a brief description
                        of what I want and then he spends the time to figure out what the problem is and how to
                        solve
                        it. Many other developers stray down the wrong path and waste your money because they don‚Äôt
                        fully understand your needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If John is not 100% sure of the direction he is headed he will setup a meeting to discuss
                        and
                        gain full clarity before proceeding forward. The main application that John has created for
                        my
                        business has completely streamlined my operation. I couldn't imagine
                        not having it at this point. It has been a pleasure working with John and I look forward to
                        working with him for years to come.

                        John and I were co-workers at PageFad. John was hired as a Junior Level Developer but
                        quickly
                        proved himself to be more knowledgeable than that. He was well versed in C#, ASP.NET, CSS,
                        JavaScript and Ajax. Now, although he was hired to do mostly Web Development
                        his skills also shined in SQL Server 2005. He worked well in both Database administration
                        and
                        design.

                    <p>
                        I would have to say his knowledge of Web Development is his greatest attribute. However,
                        that
                        is not to take away from the fact that <strong>he is very easy to work with</strong>. I would
                        definitely
                        work
                        with him again if had the chance.
